# CRYPTOTrail: Immutable Record of Token Transactions for Compliance

## 📜 Project Description
CRYPTOTrail is a blockchain-based smart contract that allows immutable logging of token transactions, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof audit trails. This project is aimed at industries requiring regulatory compliance and transaction traceability.

## 🌐 Project Vision
To establish a secure, decentralized, and auditable system that records token transaction details in a transparent way, thereby supporting regulatory and internal compliance processes.

## ✨ Key Features
- Immutable logging of transaction metadata (sender, receiver, amount, timestamp)
- Event emission for external systems to listen for transaction logs
- View functions to retrieve transaction logs and total count
- Admin functionality for contract ownership management

## 🔭 Future Scope
- Integration with token contracts to auto-log token transfers
- Advanced querying and indexing of transaction records
- Support for multi-signature transaction approvals
- Role-based access control for audit and view permissions
